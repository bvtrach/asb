# Development

Keep the project small and offline-buildable after dependencies are installed.
New behavior belongs in one of the three CLI modules and should preserve the
existing `setup` and `run` command forms.

Use the pinned Rust toolchain and run:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --locked
cargo build --locked
```

Workspaces, caches, and build outputs stay under `/srv/data/projects`. Do not
put credentials, machine-specific paths, prompts, or provider responses in the
repository. Live runs receive credentials from the agent/provider environment.
